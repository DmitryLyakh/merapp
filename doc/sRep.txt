- The sRep or string representation of a MERA.

An srep is a string. It's composed of sub-strings (tensor stanzas) separated by semicolon (;)

srep = tensor stanza ; tensor stanza ; tensor stanza ; ...

An srep may NOT end in semicolon.

An srep may contain whitespace. All whitespace is ignored. 

-- Tensor Stanza

A tensor stanza is a string. It's composed of items separated by colons (:)

tensor stanza = item : item : item : item : ...


A tensor stanza may NOT end in colon.

A tensor stanza may contain spaces. All whitespace is ignored.

Item 0 of the stanza is the name of the tensor optionally followed by * to indicate conjugation.

Item 1 of the stanza is the time index of the tensor. (Or layer in which this tensor lives.)

Item 2 of the stanza is the spatial index of the tensor. (Or number of this tensor within this layer.)

Item 3 of the stanza is the number of in legs of the tensor, a.k.a., the ins.

Item 4 of the stanza is the number of out legs of the tensor, a.k.a., the outs.

Item 4 + x of the stanza is symbolic index of in leg number x, for 0<=x<ins. If ins==0 these items are not present.

Item 4 + ins + x of the stanza is symbolic index of out leg number x, for 0<=x<outs. If outs==0 these items are not present.

A tensor stanza may NOT have ins + outs == 0.

-- Symbolic indices of legs

A symbolic index is a string formed by a letter plus a non-zero integer.
The letter can be 's' or 'f' to indicate whether the symbolic index is summed-over (s) or free (f).

-- Whitespace
One or more of the following: space, tab, eol.
