Symbolic driver:
DONE	Normalize s* indices
DONE	Environ for r
DONE	If r connects with r* --> add u99
DONE	Normalize f* indices
DONE	DimensionSrep
DONE	equal keyword
DONE	sRepEqs spec
DONE	symbolic: generate sRepEqs, use u100 and above
DONE	symbolic: generate DimensionSrep for u100 and above
DONE	symbolic should generate H only on certain links
DONE	correct last step of breakup
DONE	update testsuite
DONE	test all again
DONE	tensorBreakup: recursive
DONE    interface of TensorStanza/TensorSrep ==> all legs looping
DONE    we must have only a few reserved tensor names, and accept
	    the rest as general purpose tensor names
DONE	symmetries for temporaries
DONE	symmetry of scalars must be dealt automatically
DONE	add symmetries for irreducible identities
DONE	clean up memory of symmetries of temporaries
	move irreducible identity code into its own class if possible
	tensor in compressed form, modify looping over indices
	target one sector only in effective H
	free model
	free geometry (???)
	free builder
	stanza must combine outs and ins internally
	numbering of output tensors
	Clear output tensor storage (?)
	Figure out Layer=
	Fermions
