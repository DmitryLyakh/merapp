Symbolic driver:
DONE	Normalize s* indices
DONE	Environ for r
DONE	If r connects with r* --> add u99
DONE	Normalize f* indices
DONE	DimensionSrep
DONE	equal keyword
DONE	sRepEqs spec
DONE	symbolic: generate sRepEqs, use u100 and above
DONE	symbolic: generate DimensionSrep for u100 and above
DONE	symbolic should generate H only on certain links
DONE	correct last step of breakup
DONE	update testsuite
DONE	test all again
DONE	tensorBreakup: recursive
	move irreducible identity code into its own class if possible
	free model
	free geometry (???)
	free builder
DONE	interface of TensorStanza/TensorSrep ==> all legs looping
	we must have only a few reserved tensor names, and accept
	           the rest as general purpose tensor names
	numbering of output tensors
	Clear output tensor storage (?)
	Figure out Layer=
	Symmetries
	Fermions
